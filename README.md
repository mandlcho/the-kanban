# DoWhat ✅

> A modern, real-time todo tracker built for people who want to organize their work across multiple statuses—without the bloat.

## The Story: How This Started

### The Problem
Managing tasks across projects is chaotic. Most todo apps either:
- Force you into a flat list that doesn't scale
- Require constant switching between "backlog" and "active" views
- Don't sync across devices or feel sluggish
- Bury important features behind paywalls

I wanted a tool that:
- Shows **all my tasks at once** in a visual board (Kanban-style)
- Lets me **switch views instantly** (list or card view)
- **Syncs in real-time** across all my devices
- Supports **multiple prioritization methods** (priority levels, due dates, categories)
- **Feels fast and responsive** (no waiting)

### Building It
Instead of settling for existing solutions, I built DoWhat as part of an ongoing mission: tackling a real-world problem every weekend. This weekend project is lightweight, open-source, and built with modern web tech that actually works. Each project teaches me something new while solving something I actually need.

## What DoWhat Does

A real-time task management app that:
- 📋 Organize todos across **Backlog → Active → Done** columns
- 🎯 Set priorities (high, medium, low) and due dates with visual calendar
- 🏷️ Tag todos with custom categories for better filtering
- 👥 **Real-time sync** across devices using Supabase
- 🔄 **Drag-and-drop** reordering in both list and card views
- 🎨 Light/dark theme toggle
- 📱 Responsive design (works on mobile, tablet, desktop)
- 🔐 User authentication with email/password
- 🗂️ Archive completed tasks or restore them later

**Live Demo**: [DoWhat on GitHub Pages](https://mandlcho.github.io/DoWhat/)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- npm or yarn
- A Supabase account (free tier works great)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mandlcho/DoWhat.git
cd DoWhat
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Opens http://localhost:5173 with hot reload.

### Build & Deploy

```bash
npm run build        # Create production bundle in dist/
npm run preview      # Test the production build locally
```

---

## Setup

### Local Development

1. Create a `.env` file in the repo root:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   VITE_SITE_URL=http://localhost:5173
   ```

2. Restart `npm run dev`

### Production Deployment

Set these environment variables in your deployment platform (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages):
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `VITE_SITE_URL` (your deployed domain)

See `docs/supabase.md` for full backend setup instructions (database schema, RLS policies, real-time config).
